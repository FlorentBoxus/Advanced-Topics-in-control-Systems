## Pattern formation in intracortical neuronal fields

The goal of this project is to understand and modelize the formation of patterns in intracortical neuronal fields. To do so, the paper
 avalaible on https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10722715_Pattern_formation_in_intracortical_neuronal_fields about Pattern formation in intracortical neuronal fields written by Axel Hutt, Michael Bestehorn and Thomas Wennekers is used. This paper explains a model for both excitatory and inhibitory connections between intercortical neurons. Many studies have already been conducted to build models with both single coupled neurons and continuous neuronal fields. The specificity of the model built in the paper is that the delay for short-range continuous fields is taken into account. Because such model has already been studied but for long range condition, the authors have extended the model to shorter range.  Based on this derived model, several configurations will be tested to highlight the various patterns which can appear. We will put the emphasis on the mechanism of formation of the formation of self organized states.
